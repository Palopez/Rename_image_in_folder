# Rename images on folder

in this case the file came with a code and undercore and other alphanumeric text

32148833_hsc93331.jpg

and want it to rename it to:

1909_32148833_1.jpg

-the 1909 part of the new file name is given by an user input.

-the 32148833 part of the new file name is given by the original name before the underscore

-the 1 part of the new file name is given by a count of the "32148833" in the file names of the
 all files in the folter
 
 so, if there are these files on the folder:
 
-32148833_hsdasd1231.jpg
-32148833_hee2231431.jpg
-32148833_hsfdd33431.jpg
-45325335_hsc93331.jpg
-45325335_8jdiw9223.jpg

 after the script they will be rename like this:
 
-1909_32148833_1.jpg
-1909_32148833_2.jpg
-1909_32148833_3.jpg
-1909_45325335_1.jpg
-1909_45325335_2.jpg
 
 This will generate a bat file that has to be executed and then it will rename all the files on the folder.
 
 NOTE: THE BAT FILE HAS TO BE ON THE SAME FOLDER OF THE ORIGINAL IMAGES TO BE RENAMED.
